# Rule-Engine
 This project implements a simple 3-tier rule engine application using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite. It allows for the creation, combination, and evaluation of rules based on Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). The application is designed to efficiently manage and evaluate complex rule sets by representing rules in a structured and interpretable format

 ## Features
- User-friendly interface for entering rules
- Dynamic display of the generated AST
- Error handling for invalid rule input

## Components

1. Backend :  main.py (Flask Python SQLAlchemy)
2. Frontend : rlg.py (Tkinter UI Python)


## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask sqlalchemy requests
   
2. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Shruti1609/Rule-Engine.git

3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python ui.py

## Design Choices
 - Flask: Selected for its ease of use and flexibility, making it perfect for rapid web application development.
 - SQLite: Chosen as the database for its lightweight design and straightforward setup, ideal for smaller applications.
 - RESTful API: Used to maintain a clear separation of responsibilities and streamline communication between the frontend and backend.
 - JSON: Adopted for data exchange due to its lightweight nature and simplicity in web applications.
 - Error Handling: Integrated to offer helpful feedback to users, enhancing the overall experience.
