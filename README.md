# Rule-Engine
 This project implements a simple 3-tier rule engine application using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite. It allows for the creation, combination, and evaluation of rules based on Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). The application is designed to efficiently manage and evaluate complex rule sets by representing rules in a structured and interpretable format
